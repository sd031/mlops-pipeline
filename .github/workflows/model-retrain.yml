          ## ðŸ¤– Automated Model Retraining
          
          This PR contains a retrained model with updated performance metrics.
          
          **Training Details:**
          - Triggered: ${{ github.event_name }}
          - Run ID: ${{ github.run_number }}
          - Timestamp: ${{ github.event.head_commit.timestamp }}
          
          **Next Steps:**
          1. Review model performance metrics
          2. Test the retrained model
          3. Approve and merge if performance is satisfactory
          
          The retrained model artifacts are available in the workflow run.
